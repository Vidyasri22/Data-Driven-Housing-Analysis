# Project Name

**Detailed guidelines are posted on DEN under the `project` folder.**


## 1. Objective
This project is all about diving into details like how many houses are being sold for (from low to high prices), who's buying them, and what the economic situation is like in each area. We'll also be checking out stuff like who lives there, their incomes, and how many people are working. Additionally, we'll explore demographic factors such as household composition and enrollment in schools, to understand population trends. By putting all this together, we can help government folks, city planners, and investors figure out where to invest money and how to make housing more affordable.
